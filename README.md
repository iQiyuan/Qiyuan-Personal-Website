# Qiyuan's Personal Website

This website documents my learning journey in front-end development and serves as a personal showcase for my projects in robotics and engineering. Built on the **[vCard](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio)** template, it has been customized to meet my own design and functional needs. **The site is a work in progress and will be continuously updated.**
