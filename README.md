# Qiyuan's Personal Website

This website documents my learning journey in front-end development and serves as a personal showcase for my projects in robotics and engineering. Built on the **[vCard](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio)** template, it has been customized to meet my own design and functional needs. **The site is a work in progress and will be continuously updated.**

## Useful Resources

**It’s best to keep any uploaded file under 50MB in size.**
After converting my video to a GIF, the resulting file was extremely large. I eventually solved the issue using a mobile app called Wink.

**[Streamline](https://home.streamlinehq.com/) - Icon Library**  
If you're looking for icons, the website kkk has almost every kind of icon you could need. Each icon is customizable in terms of line thickness and color — it's incredibly useful.

**[Formspree](https://formspree.io/) - Free Form Summision**  
Formspree lets you easily handle form submissions on static websites. No backend code is needed, just connect your form to Formspree, and submissions can be sent to your email. 

**[IMGOnline](https://imgonline.tools/) - Online Image Tool**  
A lightweight, easy-to-use, and completely free image editing tool. With Chrome's Ad Blocker enabled, it’s completely ad-free. In this website design, images on the project page need to be cropped to 900px × 720px.

**[Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/) - Online File Conversion**
It can convert almost any common file type, completely free of charge. There are no ads even with an Ad Blocker enabled, but if you don’t turn off the Ad Blocker, the conversions won’t be unlimited.

**[Google_Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - Web-dev Fonts Library**
Select the font you like, then click to generate the embed code. Insert that code into your HTML file, and then update the font reference in your CSS accordingly.

**[Google_Map](https://www.google.com/maps)**
After selecting the desired location, click "Share" to generate the web embed code, then replace the corresponding section in your HTML with it.
